<h1 id="tufte-css">A Proposal for Quasi-Open Research</h1>
<h2>Just The Proposal</h2>
<p>This piece is just the proposal for a system that will require work across many different areas.
It is meant to share a vision for the future and define the problems that stand between us and said future.
Thanks for reading,

<h2>Pockets of High-Value Educational Experiences</h2>
<p>You can't learn everything on the internet. A lot of folks would disagree. They might say "You can even learn Rocket Science if you wanted to". But what about after you've learned the physics and engineering of rockets. How do you get past the math and learn all the small bits that make SpaceX engineers and JPL scientists the best in the world? After all, building a projectile has plenty of problems that span many different areas of science. There are the teams who've
    - built hyper efficent engines that pair with,
    - hardware and software that can track this 7.9 MPH object,
    - and are protected by materials that withstand extreme heats.
There is a populist misunderstanding that human knowledge and learning has a much more shallow target, achieved once one knows the fundamentals of a system. This is not true.  A majority of the knowledge I believe isn't available to you is that which approaches the boundaries of human knowledge. <img alt="" src="http://www.kouvaris.io/static/images/Learning.jpeg" />To really learn in this space, requires I'm not suggesting this information belongs to humanity. After all, research is funded for a purpose and rewards are necessary. However, its 2020 and humans have put a lot of thought into how can we make quasi-open systems that enable the public to support projects in limited ways. One of the more successful examples has got to be Bug Bounties, which have enabled security experts to effectively to explore and play within the walled gardens of institutions. The practical experience one gains here enables adept researches to move ever closer towards expert status.
So here is what I'm suggesting. A framework for research labs that lets them work effectively internally, but also opens up areas of their research to people like me who want to explore the boundaries of human knowledge but can't afford to leave their day job and actually enjoy their life. Einstein's story has been told many times. The fact that Einstein was able to go home and work on Theoretical Physics in his home was an attribute of the problems he was working on and his methods .  You could say that his "genius" enabled him to solve these without a formal environment and that others could do the same today. I would ask that person what types of problems they are working on that wouldn't dramatically benefit from higher quality data.But we've come far and we now need more infrastructure, support and collaboration to make progress. If these gardens are not opened up to some degree, many who love to explore the world but do not have the means will miss their opportunity to be Einstein.</p>
